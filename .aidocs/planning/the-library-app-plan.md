  - Return Date (Date) - actual return date (for Return entries)
- List page (read-only)
- Used as CalcFormula source for Book Available Quantity FlowField

### Business Logic

#### Posting Mechanism

- **Book Loan-Post codeunit**
  - Validates header and lines
  - Creates Posted Book Loan Header/Lines (with new Posted No. from No. Series)
  - Creates Book Loan Ledger Entries (Loan type, positive quantity)
  - Book Available Quantity automatically recalculates via FlowField
  - Rich validation messages (for translation demo):
    - "Member %1 is not active"
    - "Book %1 is not available. Available quantity: %2"
    - "Expected return date must be after loan date"
    - "Cannot post empty document"
    - Confirmation: "Do you want to post Book Loan %1?"

#### Return Processing

- **Book Return-Post codeunit**
  - Select posted book loan to return
  - Validate all books being returned
  - Create Book Loan Ledger Entries (Return type, negative quantity)
  - Record actual return date
  - Book Available Quantity automatically recalculates via FlowField
  - Validation messages:
    - "Book %1 has already been returned"
    - "Cannot return book that was not loaned"
    - Confirmation: "Do you want to register return for Posted Book Loan %1?"

#### Validations

- **ISBN Format:** Basic format check (numbers and hyphens)
- **Availability Check:** Cannot loan more books than available (via FlowField)
- **Member Status:** Only active members can loan books
- **Date Logic:** Expected return date must be after loan date
- **Quantity Restriction:** Book Loan Line quantity must be exactly 1
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Cannot add same book twice to one loan document

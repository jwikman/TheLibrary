It contains a sample AL project that demonstrates how to use the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent with NAB AL Tools, either locally or with GitHub Copilot Coding Agent in the Cloud.

## Setup GitHub Copilot Coding Agent

### Configure Copilot in the Repository settings

Configure the NAB AL Tools MCP Server for the Copilot Coding Agent by using the following MCP Configuration in your repository settings on GitHub:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "nab-al-tools-mcp": {
            "type": "local",
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "-y",
                "@nabsolutions/nab-al-tools-mcp"
            ],
            "tools": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Add the path to the BaseApp translation files to _Custom allowlist_:
`https://nabaltools.file.core.windows.net/shared/base_app_lang_files`

### Setup files in the repository

Copy the following file from this repository to your repository (create the folders if they do not exist):

- `.github\instructions\translate-xlf.instructions.md`
- `.github\instructions\mcp-servers.instructions.md`
- `.github\workflows\copilot-setup-steps.yml`
- `.github\initialize-coding-agent.ps1`
- `.github\copilot-instructions.md`

### Start using Copilot Coding Agent

After above setup, you can start using the Copilot Coding Agent in your repository by
assigning an issue or a work item to `Copilot` or by mentioning `@copilot` in a comment.

- "@Copilot, please make sure that all texts are translated."
- "@Copilot, please translate this app into French and German."

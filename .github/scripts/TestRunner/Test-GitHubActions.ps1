.SYNOPSIS
    Test script for running AL tests in GitHub Actions

.DESCRIPTION
    Tests the Run-ALTests.ps1 script against a BC container running on localhost
    Designed for Linux/GitHub Actions environments
    
    NOTE: This script requires the Business Central WebClient to be accessible.
    For Docker/Wine-based BC environments without WebClient, use run-tests-odata.ps1 instead.

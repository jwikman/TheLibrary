# Generic Instructions

## Information Gathering

### Never Assume
- Always ask clarifying questions when information is missing or unclear
- Do not proceed with assumptions without user confirmation
- Request specific details rather than inferring requirements

### Documentation Reading
When given documentation to review:
- **Local files**: Read completely, including all referenced files and nested content
- **Online documentation** (using `fetch` tool): Read main page and up to 2 levels of subpages
- Understand the documentation fully before taking action

## Tool Usage

### Error Handling and Recovery
When a tool call returns an error or unexpected response:
- **Analyze the error message** - Read the full response carefully
- **Follow provided instructions** - Error messages often contain specific guidance on how to resolve the issue
- **Take corrective action** - Adjust parameters, call prerequisite tools, or try alternative approaches
- **Do not repeat failed calls** - If a tool call fails, understand why before retrying

**Common scenarios:**
- Missing prerequisites: Call required tools first (e.g., set context before querying)
- Invalid parameters: Adjust parameter values based on error guidance
- Tool limitations: Use alternative tools or approaches
- Dependency issues: Resolve dependencies before proceeding

**Example:**
```
Error: "Workspace context not set. Call mcp_bc-code-intel_set_workspace_info first."
Action: Call set_workspace_info with the app source path, then retry original query
```

## File Operations

### Explicit Authorization Required
- Do not update, create, or delete files unless explicitly instructed
- Ask for confirmation when the instruction is ambiguous
- Verify scope of changes before proceeding

### Meta-File Updates
When updating instruction files (`.instructions.md`), prompt files (`.prompt.md`), or agent files (`.agent.md`):
- Make changes with appropriate priority relative to existing content
- Use normal formatting (avoid excessive emphasis like "CRITICAL", "MUST NOT", "IMPORTANT")
- Make targeted updates rather than reformatting the entire file
- Match the tone and style of the existing file content

### Markdown Formatting
When creating or editing markdown files, follow common markdown best practices and formatting standards to avoid linter warnings

## Communication

### Question Format
When presenting options to users:
1. Always provide numbered alternatives when possible
2. Place the recommended option as **number 1** with justification
3. Include 3-5 relevant alternatives when applicable
4. Use open-ended questions only when alternatives cannot be determined without additional context

**Example:**
```
How many story points should this user story have?
1. 1 point - Very simple, well-understood change (Recommended - single page update with clear requirements)
2. 2 points - Simple feature with clear requirements
3. 3 points - Moderate complexity, some unknowns
4. 5 points - Complex feature, multiple components
5. 8 points - Large feature, significant unknowns

Please select 1-5, or provide your own assessment.
```

### Iterative Approach
When gathering requirements or clarifying details:
1. Ask when information is unclear
2. Present numbered alternatives when multiple options exist
3. Validate understanding by summarizing back to user
4. Ask one question at a time for complex topics
5. Confirm before proceeding with assumptions

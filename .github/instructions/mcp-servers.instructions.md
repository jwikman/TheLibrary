- **Purpose:** Used for translation workflows and AL localization support.
- **Recommended Usage:**
  - Use for extracting, managing, and synchronizing XLF files and translations.
  - Preferred for automating translation tasks, reviewing translation states, and ensuring localization consistency.

### Available Tools

1. **initialize** (MCP only)
   - Initializes the MCP server with the AL app folder path and optional workspace file path
   - Must be called before any other tool
   - Locates the generated XLF file (.g.xlf) in the Translations folder
   - Loads the app manifest from app.json
   - Configures global settings

2. **getGlossaryTerms**
   - Returns glossary terminology pairs for a target language
   - Based on Business Central terminology and translations
   - Outputs JSON array of objects with 'source', 'target', and 'description'

3. **refreshXlf**
   - Refreshes and synchronizes a XLF language file using the generated XLF file
   - Preserves existing translations while adding new translation units
   - Maintains the state of translated units and sorts the file

4. **getTextsToTranslate**
   - Retrieves untranslated texts from a specified XLF file
   - Returns translation objects with id, source text, source language, context, maxLength, and comments
   - Supports pagination with offset and limit parameters

5. **getTranslatedTextsMap**
   - Retrieves previously translated texts from a specified XLF file as a translation map
   - Groups all translations by their source text
   - Useful for maintaining translation consistency

6. **getTranslatedTextsByState**
   - Retrieves translated texts filtered by their translation state
   - States include: 'needs-review', 'translated', 'final', 'signed-off'
   - Returns objects with id, source text, target text, context, and state information

7. **saveTranslatedTexts**
   - Writes translated texts to a specified XLF file
   - Accepts an array of translation objects with unique identifiers
   - Enables efficient updating of XLF files with new or revised translations

8. **createLanguageXlf**
   - Creates a new XLF file for a specified target language
   - Based on the generated XLF file from the initialized app
   - Optionally pre-populated with matching translations from Microsoft's base application

9. **getTextsByKeyword**
   - Searches source or target texts in an XLF file for a given keyword or regex
   - Returns matching translation units
   - Useful for discovering how specific words or phrases are used across the application

.SYNOPSIS
    Start Business Central container and wait for it to become healthy

.DESCRIPTION
    Starts the BC container using Docker Compose and monitors its health status

.PARAMETER MaxWaitSeconds
    Maximum time to wait for container to become healthy in seconds (default: 1200 = 20 minutes)

.PARAMETER IncludeSqlLogs
    Include SQL Server logs in output (default: false). By default, only BC container logs are shown.

.PARAMETER Quiet
    Suppress incremental log output during health check (default: false). Only show logs on failure or completion.

.EXAMPLE
    ./start-bc-container.ps1
    ./start-bc-container.ps1 -MaxWaitSeconds 1200
    ./start-bc-container.ps1 -IncludeSqlLogs
    ./start-bc-container.ps1 -Quiet
